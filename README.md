# p3rpc.expShare

A simple P3R mod that does EXP sharing across both active and inactive party and stock personas.

## Features
- Growth 3 for all Personas. (Can be disabled via mod config)
- Everyone gets the same EXP as Hero
- Respect join dates for characters (Won't grant EXP if the character has not yet joined SEES)

## Planned features
- [ ] Exp multiplier for party
- [ ] Mode to distribute total earned EXP among all party members instead of getting hero EXP (For example if you earn 100 EXP, everyone can get 10 EXP instead of 100 EXP)

## Special Thanks
- AnimatedSwine: I took a lot of inspiration from their existing mods
- ZArkadia: For their P3R Ghidra pre-analyzed dump and the awesome guides documented in their server
